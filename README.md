#### _Application to list products and reviews, 1/17/2020_

#### By _**Drew Peterson**_

## Description

_This Application in Ruby-Rails is a code review I completed for my boot camp, Epidcodus.  It is a test required to be finished in 8 hours to these specifications:_

* Create from scratch Ruby/Rails app for a food importer showcasing their imported products.
* Create an authentication system for users to log in.
* Create functionality for users to submit reviews for each product listed.
* Create admin authentication.
* Provide a Capybara test suite.
* Complete this project in 8 hours of programming and submit it for instructor code review.

_to list products and reviews including CRUD functionality with authentication and admin permissions._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Requires Ruby 2.6.5, Rails 5.2.4 and PostgresQL. 
* Clone the project locally from github.
* Install Bundler if you do not already have it by running gem install bundler in the terminal.
* Run bundle install to manage gems; if you make additional changes to the Gemfile, you will need to run this command again.
* DATABASE INSTRUCTIONS - from terminal in the the root directory of this project, run these commands:
*   rake db:create
*   rake db:migrate
*   rake db:test:prepare
*   rake db:seed

## Known Bugs

_Given the 8 hour time constraint, there priority was to focus on functionality and testing over styling. As a result the styling is minimal._

_One known bug for testing was in dealing with creation of an admin profile, I wasn't able to find how to reliably test with the checkbox for admin.  I did pass the code review despite missing detail._
